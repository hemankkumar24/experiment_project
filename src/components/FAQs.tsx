      question: 'What industries do you specialize in?',
      answer: 'Our team works across diverse industries such as tech, wellness, healthcare, education, real estate, finance, entertainment, and retail. Each project is led by specialists who understand your space inside out.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a typical project take?',
      answer: 'Most projects are completed within 2-6 weeks, depending on the scope and feedback cycles. We keep timelines clear from day one so you always know what to expect.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I just need one service?',
      answer: 'That works perfectly. We can integrate seamlessly with your team and handle exactly what you need, whether it\'s design, content, or development, without any extra layers or long-term commitments.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does your pricing work, and do you offer ongoing support?',
      answer: 'Our pricing is transparent and tailored to your specific needs. Each project begins with a clear quote based on its scope, whether it\'s a website, brand identity, or design and content work. We don\'t include maintenance charges by default; these are discussed with you upfront, based on the level of post-launch support you need. For brands that want continued assistance, we offer flexible monthly retainers for maintenance, updates, optimization, and creative support while you stay focused on growth.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why wouldn\'t I just hire a full-time team for this?',
      answer: 'Hiring in-house often means higher costs, especially for expert-level designers, developers, and strategists. Plus, you might not always have enough work to keep everyone engaged, leaving you paying for downtime. With ScalKit, you get top-tier expertise, only when you need it.',
